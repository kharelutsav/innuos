# Decisions:
1   Many smaller queries though increases overhead, helps reduce the unnecessary 
    database queries. But, due to insufficient knowledge on requirements, large
    queries are used for updating in-memory cache (No cache libraries used.).
    Could be modified if required.

2   Database: 1
    Tables: 3
        1   library:
                library_name (Primary Key)
        2   music:
                music_name (Primary Key)
                music_file (Relative path to the image file.)  (Not null)
                thumbnail_image (Relative path to the image file.) (Null allowed)
        3   collection:
                library_name (Foreign Key) (Indexed)
                music_name (Foreign Key) (Indexed)

# Mistakes: Confused playlists with library

# TODO: Work on upload function
The update function should be able to receive updates on music library.
Create playlist to create and manage playlists.
Create endpoints to get and update playlists.
Update cache class to classify libraries and playlists.
This much for tomorrow.
